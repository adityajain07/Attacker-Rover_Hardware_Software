# About
This project has an end-to-end implementation (from simulation to actual deployment on hardware) for a ground rover (attacker), more technically called as a UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle), to avoid another ground rover (defender) and reach a goal position. Involves building the rover, path planning, path following, writting the controller, testing in simulation and finally deployment on a real ground rover.
The project has various phases:
* Building a rover using the available hardware and drive manually
* Deployment of autopilot system on the rover and able to do autonomous missions
* Setup of ArduRover SITL simulator and making a connection with the ROS system using mavros
* Testing of controller and tune the PID gains so that the rover is able to follow a set of waypoints (in simulation)
* Testing of the path planning algorithm to avoid the defender rover and reach the goal position (in simulation)
* Finally testing the entire system on a real ground rover
